        *Thank you for taking the time to report a bug!*
        
        Before reporting, please verify that you are using the latest version of the `@vis.gl/react-google-maps` library.
        
        You may find answers faster by searching in [the documentation](https://visgl.github.io/react-google-maps/search) and [existing issues](https://github.com/visgl/react-google-maps/issue).
        If you are unsure whether it is a bug in your own implementation or the library itself, consider starting a conversation in [Discussions](https://github.com/visgl/react-google-maps/discussions) instead.
